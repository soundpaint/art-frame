==== X Autostart ====

* Make RasPi boot into text console with auto login (e.g. via
  raspi-config).

* Create "~/.bash_login":

$ cp -ip ~/art-frame/scripts/bash_login ~/.bash_login

In case the file ~/.bash_login already exists, make a backup of the
existing file!  Also, you may then want to merge the contents of file
~/art-frame/scripts/bash_login into your existing ~/.bash_login rather
than overwriting the existing file.

* Disable Xsession screen saver by editing /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart:

$ sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart

Comment out with comment character "#" (or remove the line completely):

  # @xscreensaver -no-splash

Add the following lines:

  # art-frame: no screen saver
  @xset s noblank
  @xset s off
  @xset -dpms

Quit the editor with CTRL-X.

* Optionally: Rotate LCD screen by 180 degrees, useful for some Pi cases

$ sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Append to the end the following two lines:

  # art frame: rotate LCD screen by 180 degrees
  lcd_rotate=2

Quit the editor with CTRL-X.

* Optionally: Disable touch (usually, you do *not* want to do this,
  unless you want to show a self-running demo only without any user
  interaction)

$ sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Append to the end the following two lines:

  # art frame: disable touch functionaly
  disable_touchscreen=1

==== Audio Configuration [optional] ====

Ensure audio comes out of the 3.5mm jack rather than via HDMI:

$ sudo raspi-config
[select "7 Advanced Options" > "A4 Audio" > "1 Force 3.5mm ('headphone') jack"]
[select "Ok"]
[select "Finish"]

Select maximum volume:

$ alsamixer
[select maximum volume]
[press "Esc" key to exit]

==== Images Configuration [optional] ====

If you want add or replace the images displayed by the art-frame
application, then the configuration file
~/art-frame/build/bin/config.xml.  In the section "images" at the
bottom of the file, specify which images to use.  Provide those images
referred to in the config.xml file at the file path that is specified
in the configuration file.
